# ⚽ Game Brief – Physics & Lighting Learning Prototype
 
This project is a learning-focused prototype built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to explore and demonstrate core game development concepts related to physics simulation and dynamic lighting.

### 🧪 Learning Goals:
Physics Simulation:
Simulates how speed, velocity, and direction affect a ball projectile when shot or launched in-game.

### Lighting System:
Experiments with Unreal Engine’s lighting systems, including shadows, reflections, and environmental effects using Lumen.

### Motion Dynamics:
Tests how objects move and react under gravity, collisions, and impulse forces — ideal for understanding realistic movement in games.

## ⚙️ Features:
Ball shooting mechanics with variable speed and direction.

Real-time lighting reacting to the environment and movement.

Minimalist UI to focus on physical behavior and visual clarity.

This prototype serves as a foundational step for building more complex interactions, such as projectile combat or sports-based gameplay, while gaining hands-on experience with Unreal Engine’s physics engine and lighting systems.
